# Cybersecurity Research Project
This repository contains a research project completed at the University of Texas Permian Basin. The primary goal of this project is to educate and raise awareness about potential vulnerabilities in popular open-source packages, using Python as an example.

## ðŸš€ Purpose
As the software development ecosystem evolves, understanding potential risks is paramount. This project aims to showcase:

- Vulnerabilities in popular open-source Python packages.
- The significance of robust package and dependency management.
- The importance of secure communication protocols.
- Code protection methods and their role in software security.
- NOTE: This project was developed in a controlled academic environment with ethical considerations at the forefront. No real malicious intent is present, and the repository exists purely for educational purposes.

## ðŸ›  Features
Code Injection Experiment: A controlled demonstration of how code can be injected into legitimate packages, emphasizing the importance of cautious package adoption.
SMTP Simulation: A mock data extraction using SMTP to illustrate the importance of secure communication.
Code Obfuscation with PyArmor: A study into obfuscation tools to understand methods of code protection and their implications.
## ðŸ“˜ Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to emphasize the role of proactive cybersecurity measures for budding software developers and seasoned professionals alike. The project showcases potential pitfalls and the need for vigilance in the ever-evolving software landscape.
